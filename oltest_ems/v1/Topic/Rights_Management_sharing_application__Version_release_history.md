## Version 1.0.2004.0
**Released**: 12/11/2015

**Fixes**:

-   Only the file owner and people with **Co-Owner** permissions levels can unprotect files. Previously, the owner and people with **Co-Author** and **Co-owner** permissions levels could unprotect files.

-   Native protection for **.tif** files (in addition to .tiff files), to produce an RMS-protected, read-only **.ptif** file.

-   Improvements for error messages (accuracy and clarity).

-   Performance improvements for encrypting and decrypting content.

**New features**:

-   Support for non-administrator installation, so that standard users can install the RMS sharing application.

    There are some restrictions for standard users who run Office 2010. For more information, see the  [If you are not a local administrator and use Office 2010](../Topic/Download_and_install_the_Rights_Management_sharing_application.md#BKMK_SetupOffice2010) section in the [Download and install the Rights Management sharing application](../Topic/Download_and_install_the_Rights_Management_sharing_application.md)  user instructions.

## Version 1.0.1908.0
**Released**: 9/16/2015

**Fixes**:

-   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Azure RMS, which also removes the dependency on the Microsoft Sign-in Assistant for applications that use modern authentication.

    For more information, see the [Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Azure RMS](../Topic/Requirements_for_Azure_Rights_Management.md#BKMK_MFA)   section in  [Requirements for Azure Rights Management](../Topic/Requirements_for_Azure_Rights_Management.md).

## Version 1.0.1784.0
**Released**: 7/30/2015

**Fixes**:

-   The default refresh interval for rights policy templates is reduced from 7 days to 1 day.

## Version 1.0.1770.0
**Released**: 4/25/2015

**Fixes**:

    -   You can now select templates.

    -   Instead of the slider, you will see a list box that includes templates and custom permissions.

    -   You no longer see options for **Allow consumption on all devices** and **Enforce usage restrictions**. Instead, **Generic Protection** is automatically selected, depending on the file type.
