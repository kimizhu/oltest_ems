# Use keyboard shortcuts in the Rights Management sharing application
When you use the RMS sharing application, press the **Alt** key to see the available access keys, and then press **Alt** + the access key to select an option.

For example, in the **share protected** dialog box, press **Alt** to see the access keys, and then press **Alt + m** to select the **Email me when somebody tries to open these documents** check box.
